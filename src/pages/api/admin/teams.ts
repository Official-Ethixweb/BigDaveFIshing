 * Creating a team link.

 * already exists" or "Complete the team details" — with the form wiped, so whoever was
 * making the link had to retype everything and guess which field was wrong. A one-letter
 * leader name and a duplicate number looked much the same from the outside: it just
 * didn't work.
 *
 * Now the specific reason and the values already typed come back with the redirect, so
 * the form can repopulate itself and point at the actual problem.
